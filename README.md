## Homework Assignments

### Seeplusia

**Description:** The first assignment, Seeplusia, involved creating a fictional world using object-oriented programming principles. This project focused on fundamental OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### GhostBusters

**Description:** The second assignment, GhostBusters, was about simulating a ghost-catching scenario. The objective was to deepen the understanding of classes and inheritance by implementing a hierarchy of ghost and ghostbuster classes with specific behaviors and interactions.

### Package Delivery

**Description:** The third assignment, part 1, involved developing a package delivery system. This assignment introduced more complex interactions between objects and emphasized the importance of object composition and collaboration.

### HUMania

**Description:** These assignments are a continuation of the same project, HUMania. They build upon each other, with HW3 (part 2) and HW4 leading up to the final version in HW5. The HUMania project involved creating an interactive application, showcasing advanced object-oriented programming techniques such as event-driven programming, GUI design, and more complex data structures.
